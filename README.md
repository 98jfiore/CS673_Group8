## Team 8: Patient Communication Mobile App

Roster
* Joseph Fiore - Microserverices Developer
* Calin Blauth - Data Architect
* David Amajor - Quality & Dev Ops
* Kadiri Venkata Thorannath - UI/UX Developer

### Far Vision

We will design an application for healthcare patients who want a way to access their healthcare information on the go.
The Patient Communication Mobile App is a mobile based application that allows the patient to track their appointments, message their doctor, check their account information, and alert them of upcoming appointments.
Unlike other mobile healthcare applications like MyChart our product displays all the necessary information in a single place that is clean and easy to navigate, all at the touch of a finger.

### Near Vision as of 9/22/2021

We will work together with the other teams to get an application to display basic patient and appointment information with UI that doesn't clash with the web version, which could confuse customers.

### Stakeholders

#### Stakeholder Types
Patients who need access to their healthcare information and appointments when they are on the go.
Doctors/Nurses who need a way to ensure their patients are getting proper care and access.
Our Company who will benefit from expanding our customer base to those who prefer to have healthcare information on hand at all times.

#### Real Stakeholder

Jane Doe
A 35 year old single-mother of two living in Cranford, New Jersey.  She is very busy balancing her life, career, and kids, and strugles remembering all of her healthcare information and appointment times/dates.
She has tried other applications, but they haven't been as useful as she wants.  She's not particularly tech savy, so the more complicated portals have been a nightmare to navigate.  Others have not included all of the features she wanted so she had to use multiple at once.  Additionally, she gets nervous about her children's health and finds getting in contact with their doctors difficult.
